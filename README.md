# PH388 - computational physics/algorithms class

Project 1 as part of the PH388 comp phys course contains the algorithms:
- Gaussian Elimination
- Gauss-Seidel
- Jacobi 
- Successive Over Relaxation

These were created in collabaration and were applied in:
- Solving a circuit system through KVL
- Visualizing the potential field of a point charge by solving the 2D Poisson eq
